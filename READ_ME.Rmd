# Jupyter Notebook Docker Container

This repository contains a Docker image for running a Jupyter Notebook with Python 
and to read in the ***taxonomic_data.csv*** and perform the following tasks:   

  1. Calculate total species count for each taxonomic phylum and the average species count per species within each phylum. Write the results to *csv* files.   
  
  2. Generate a bar chart showing the total species count for each phylum.


## How to Build and Run

1. **Build the Docker Image**:
  ```bash
docker build -t jupyter-notebook-image .
```

2. **Run the Docker Image**:
```bash
docker run -p 8888:8888 jupyter-notebook-image
```
3. **Access the Jupyter Notebook**:

Open a browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:8888 to access the Jupyter Notebook.
